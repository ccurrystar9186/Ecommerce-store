# Ecommerce-store
This assignment came with starter code, which included the config, db, and seeds folders. I added code to the models and routes folders' files, which connected the e-commerce database to the server.

Installation
Run npm i in your terminal to install all of this repo's dependencies. The dependencies are:

Usage
Log into your mysql and run the commands: SOURCE db/schema.sql; and SOURCE seeds/index.js.
